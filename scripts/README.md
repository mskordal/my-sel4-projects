# Scripts for usage and automation

## extract-functions.sh
This script parses a C source file and outputs locally defined functions along
with an id for them separated by space. The main function is guar anteed to get
id 1 while every other function will get id >=2 determined by alphabetical
order. Output is written on the `functions.txt` file. 

**NOTE**: Remove the main function for now from the list. There is the issue
where the page to the HLS IP address is mapped in the main function and the pass
does not do that yet.

example output:
```txt
<func_name_x> 2
<func_name_y> 3
<func_name_z> 4
main 1
```

## pass.sh
This script is used to automate the building and testing procedure for the LLVM
pass. It must be run from the build directory used to build the pass. It can
perform the following actions:
1. Cleans the build directory, builds make files with cmake and creates an IR
   file called app.ll from app.c using clang.
2. Compiles the pass with make.
3. Injects the pass on the source file app.c using clang and produces app
   executable.
4. Injects the pass on the IR file app.ll using opt and produces app executable.

For instruction run with -h or open and view instructions in the beginning of
the script.

## sel4-compile.sh
Automates the compilation and build process of sel4. Must run from within the
sel4 build directory. Performs the following steps:
1. Empties build directory.
2. Runs `init-build.sh` located at sel4 root dir with flags for compiling on the
   ZCU102 board and with clang instead of gcc. The script generates the ninja
   build files based on cmake.
3. Runs `ninja` to build the project.

## llvmpass-compile.sh
Automates the compilation and build process of the llvm pass. Must run from
within the sel4 build directory. Performs the following steps:
1. Sets the `LLVM_DIR` variable to llvm-15 binaries.
2. Empties the build directory.
3. Runs cmake with the `LT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR` flag pointing to `LLVM_DIR` and
   path to the `myLlvmPass` directory where the source files are located.

## init-board.tcl
Must be sourced from within `xsct`. Connects to the MpSoC of zcu102. Loads
important files such as `fsbl` and then downloads the sel4 image to the core.
Finally sets target to PSU where we can perform memory reads and writes. Must be
used after loading the hardware to the FPGA.

## init-boardhw.tcl
Similar to `init-board.tcl` but does not download the image to the core. Used
for testing the hardware without an Image using memory reads and writes.

## read-bram.tcl
Must be sourced from within `xsct`. Performs a series of reads from BRAM and
outputs raw data of words and its addresses to a txt file named `cg-data.txt`.

## cg-data-to-csv.sh
Takes an input file generated by `read-bram.tcl` and creates a csv file with readable call-graph data.
